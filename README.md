## üìùNotes

- **CAS Division (Remote Sensing Field)**: Journals are classified based on their academic influence, with Q1 being the highest and Q4 the lowest. Actual divisions may change yearly. Journals marked **Top** are leading journals in their respective categories.
- **Recommendations**:
  - For highly innovative and significant research, prioritize leading Q1 journals such as **RSE**, **IEEE TGRS**, or **ISPRS J. P&RS**.
  - For application-oriented research, consider **JSTARS** or **GRSL**.
  - For review articles or specific thematic studies, choose **RS** or **MDPI RS**.
